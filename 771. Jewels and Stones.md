## 771. Jewels and Stones

Strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, 

S representing the stones.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have. 

You want to know how many of the stones are jewels.

* The letters in J are distinct, 

* all characters in J and S are letters. 

* Letters are case sensitive: "a" is a different type of stone from "A".

### Example 1:
```python
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.

* The characters in J are distinct.


### My code
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int: 
        res=[s for s in S if (s in J) ] 
        return len(res)
```
**List comprehension**
```python
[expression for item in list]
```

**Conditionals in List Comprehension**
```python
number_list = [ x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int: 
        res=[]
        for s in S:
            if (s in J):
                res.append(s )
        return len(res)
 ```



* Wrong one
```python 
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int: 
        for s in S:
            res=[s for s in J]                  # this will change the value of s we created in line above
        return res
```
      
* Output

```python
['a', 'A']
```
