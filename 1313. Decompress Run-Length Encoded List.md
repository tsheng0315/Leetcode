## 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements ''[freq, val] = [nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i+1]]'' (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.





## my code
```python
class Solution:
    def decompressRLElist(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        output=[]
        length=int( (len(nums))/2)
        for i in range(0,length):
            freq,val=nums[2*i],nums[2*i+1]
            
            for j in range(freq):
                output.append(val)

        return output
```
