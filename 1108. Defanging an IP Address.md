## 1108. Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

#### Hint: 
attention: output is a string, shouldn't be a list!!!


#### My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        newAddress=''
        for item in address:
            if item=='.':
                item ='[.]'
            newAddress+=item
        return newAddress
```

#### Dom's suggestion:
wrong one:
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char    if char!='.' else char='[.]'   for char in address)
 ```

```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char    if char!='.' else '[.]'   for char in address)
```
    
#### Dom's version
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return address.replace(".", "[.]")
```
