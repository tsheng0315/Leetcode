## 1108. Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

#### Hint: 
attention: output is a string, shouldn't be a list!!!


#### My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        newAddress=''
        for item in address:
            if item=='.':
                item ='[.]'
            newAddress+=item
        return newAddress
```

#### Dom's suggestion:
wrong one:
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char    if char!='.' else char='[.]'   for char in address)
 ```

**Ternary Operators:**

value_if_true **if** condition **else** value_if_false

```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char    if char!='.' else '[.]'   for char in address)
```
    
#### Dom's version
```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return address.replace(".", "[.]")
```

Create an output string. For every character within the IPv4 address supplied, either append to the output string that character or "[.]" should the character at that position be a period.
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        output = ""
        
        for char in address:
            if char != ".":
                output += char
            else:
                output += "[.]"
                
        return output
This can be rewritten to employ a ternary operator:

class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        output = ""
        
        for char in address:
            output += char if char != "." else "[.]"
                
        return output
This can be further rewritten to employ Python list comprehension:

class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return "".join([char if char != "." else "[.]" for char in address])
