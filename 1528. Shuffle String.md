## 1528. Shuffle String

Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

### Example 1:
``` python
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

### Constraints:

* s.length == indices.length == n
* 1 <= n <= 100
* s contains only lower-case English letters.
* 0 <= indices[i] < n
* All values of indices are unique (i.e. indices is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n - 1).

### Hint 1:

* Create an auxiliary string t of length n.

### Hint 2

* Assign t[indexes[i]] to s[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

### My code
```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        t=[None]*len(s)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            index=indices[i]
            t[index]=s[i]

        return ''.join(t)
 ```
