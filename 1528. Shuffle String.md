## 1528. Shuffle String

Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

### Example 1:
``` python
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

### Constraints:

* s.length == indices.length == n
* 1 <= n <= 100
* s contains only lower-case English letters.
* 0 <= indices[i] < n
* All values of indices are unique (i.e. indices is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n - 1).

### Hint 1:

* Create an auxiliary string t of length n.

### Hint 2

* Assign t[indexes[i]] to s[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

### My code
```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        t=[None]*len(s)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            index=indices[i]
            t[index]=s[i]

        return ''.join(t)
 ```
### Domn's
Construct an output array of length equal to the number of characters contained within the string s supplied as input. For each (pos, char) pair, set the value of the element at position pos equal to the character given by char. Employ Python's join method to convert the output array into a string using the string separator "".

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        length = len(s)
        output = [None] * length
        
        for i in range(length):
            pos, char = indices[i], s[i]
            output[pos] = char
            
        return "".join(output)
```    

This can be rewritten to employ a zip function:

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        output = [None] * len(s)
        
        for pos, char in zip(indices, [char for char in s]):
            output[pos] = char
            
        return "".join(output)
```
