## 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

 
#### Example 1:
```python
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
```
Explanation: 

Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 

Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.


#### Hint:

Use greedy approach. For each kid check if candies[i] + extraCandies â‰¥ maximum in Candies[i].

#### MyCode:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        kidList=[]
        for kid in candies:
            kidList.append(kid + extraCandies >=max(candies))
        return kidList
             
```
#### Dom's suggestion:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        kidList=[]
        maxCandy=max(candies)
        for kid in candies:
            kidList.append(kid + extraCandies >= maxCandy)  # save computation
        return kidList
```
#### Dom's code

Determine the number of candies any child must currently have such that, given they recieve all of the extra candies, they have the most candies.

For each child, determine if the number of candies held by that child meets, or exceeds, that figure.

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        candies_to_beat = max(candies) - extraCandies
        
        for i, no_candies in enumerate(candies):
            if no_candies >= candies_to_beat:
                candies[i] = True
            else:
                candies[i] = False
        
        return candies
```        
#### This can be rewritten to employ a ternary operator:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        candies_to_beat = max(candies) - extraCandies
        
        for i, no_candies in enumerate(candies):
            candies[i] = True if no_candies >= candies_to_beat else False
        
        return candies
```

#### This can be further rewritten to employ Python list comprehension:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        max_ = max(candies)
        return [extraCandies + candy >= max_ for candy in candies]
```
